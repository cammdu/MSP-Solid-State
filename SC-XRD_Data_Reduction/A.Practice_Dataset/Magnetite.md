# Quick Note
The files uploaded to folder **A.Practice_Dataset** are Eiger files containing data collected at the ESRF by Giuditta Perversi. The use of these files is soley to familiarise students with complex crystallographic data processing.

## Geometry and Parameters of these files which will be neded during data processing:
- exposure time = 0.25 seconds
- distance to the crystal = 0.129
- centre of the detector = 1046.0 1130.0
- wavelength = 0.2776
- omega = "0.1*index"
