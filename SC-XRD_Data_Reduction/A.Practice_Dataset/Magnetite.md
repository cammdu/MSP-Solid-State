# Quick Note
The files uploaded to the **README** are Eiger files containing data collected at the ESRF by Giuditta Perversi. The use of these files is soley to familiarise students with complex crystallographic data processing and is only accessible to students with permission to access Surfdrive via Maastricht University.

## Geometry and Parameters of these files which will be neded during data processing:
- exposure time = 0.25 seconds
- distance to the crystal = 0.129
- centre of the detector = 1046.0 1130.0
- wavelength = 0.2776
- omega = "0.1*index"
