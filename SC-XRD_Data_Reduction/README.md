# Single Crystal X-Ray Diffraction (SC-XRD) Data Reduction Repository
## Identity
**Created by:** Chloë Cammaerts

**Reason:** Bachelor Thesis Research 

## Purpose
- This repository provides users a step-by-step guide through the SC-XRD data reduction process using state-of-the-art tools such as DIALS and Mdx2. 
- This process can either be followed with the user's own dataset(s) or by using the provided data set of magnetite at room temperature (25°C) (_STILL TO BE UPLOADED)_
