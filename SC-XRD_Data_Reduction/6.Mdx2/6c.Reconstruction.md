# Merging and Scaling Your Dataset to Create the 3D Reconstruction
## Merging
- merging is significant to group the number of repeating observations with the same Laue group 
- to start merging use the merge function:
```
mdx2.merge corrected.nxs --outfile merged_not_scaled.nxs
```
- this will output a table, to inspect this:
```
mdx2.map geometry.nxs merged_not_scaled.nxs --limits hx hy kx ky lx ly --outfile slice_not_scaled.nxs
```
- herein you should input whichever slice you want. It is conventional to start with a slice where l=0 like so:
```
mdx2.map geometry.nxs merged_not_scaled.nxs --limits hx hy kx ky 0 0 --outfile slice_not_scaled.nxs
```
- For the practice data set, good parameters are -30 30 -30 30 00
- now open **slice_not_scaled.nxs** in NeXpy to visualise it. 

## Scaling
- Mdx2 has a function called scale which runs through 5 iterations to make model to scale the data. 
- scaling is important as it essentially normalises the data. This allows your data to be compared to others. 
1. Make your model:
```
mdx2.scale corrected.nxs
```
- this will save your model to a file named **scales.nxs**
- to plot this:

```
#import packages
from mdx2.utils import loadobj

Model = loadobj('scales.nxs','scaling_model')
Model.to_nexus().plot()
```
- this will output a plot of your model. 

## 2D Slice
1. Apply your model to your merged data:
```
mdx2.merge corrected.nxs --scale scales.nxs
```
- this will output **merged.nxs**

2. Now map the l=0 slice of the merged and scaled data

```
mdx2.map geometry.nxs merged.nxs --limits hx hy kx ky 0 0 --outfile slice.nxs
```
- For the practice data set, good parameters are still -30 30 -30 30 00
3. Inspect **slice.nxs** in NeXpy
## 3D Reconstruction
1. Use the map function above and change the lx and ly to encompass the whole l range.  
```
mdx2.map geometry.nxs merged.nxs --limits hx hy kx ky lx ly --outfile map.nxs
```
- The parameters for the practice data set are -20 20 -20 20 -20 20
2. Inspect the 3D reconstruction in NeXpy
