# Automate running XDS:

1. Make a file called XDS_peak_hunt.INP 
- copy paste XDS.INP into this file. 
- make sure that the line below is commented out with **!**:
```
 !JOB= IDXREF DEFPIX INTEGRATE CORRECT
```
- for every new dataset, change the path to the new folder if your folder changes
2. Make a file called XDS_integrate.INP
- copy paste XDS.INP into this file. 
- make sure that the line below is **not** commented out with **!**:
```
 JOB= IDXREF DEFPIX INTEGRATE CORRECT
```
- for every new dataset, change the path to the new folder iff your folder changes

3. Make a python script called xds_automate.sh
4. copy paste the code below:
```
cp ../xds_template/XDS_peak_hunt.INP XDS.INP
xds
cp SPOT.XDS SPOT.XDS_bak
head -n 3000 SPOT.XDS_bak > SPOT.XDS
cp ../xds_template/XDS_integrate.INP XDS.INP
xds
```
5. Place these 3 files in a folder that is in the same directory as your cbf images and name it _xds_template_
5. Now, when you want to run xds for a new dataset, run the code below in your command line:
```
../xds_template/xds_commands_automate.sh
```
