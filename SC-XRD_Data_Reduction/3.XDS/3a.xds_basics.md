# XDS
- xds is run entirely through **XDS.INP**. In this file, you can specify the geometry and experimental parameters of your experiment. This function is necessary as most crystallographic experiments do not use standardised parameters.
- The most important files in xds are:
-   XDS.INP: command file
-   SPOT.XDS: peak file
-   XPARM.XDS: parameter file
## How to use XDS:
1. Via your command line, activate your python 3.9 environment/ last stable release environment and then go to your xds directory . 
2. XDS will try to find the unit cell for your inputted data, to run it, run 
```
% xds
```
- if this operation fails, run:
```
% cp SPOT.XDS SPOT.XDS_bak 
% head -n XXXX SPOT.XDS_bak > SPOT.XDS
% xds
```
- where XXXX is the number of Bragg peaks to be displayed. 
- this should output xds running through all the peaks. 

3. XPARM.XDS is the output file and can be read using a TextEdit application. It will be an array of numbers without headers, but from left to right can be approximately read as:

| - | Theta (angle) | X | Y | Z |
| :---         |     :---:      |   :---:    |   :---: | ---:
| Wavelength   | - | Vectors along Z     | Vectors along Z    | Vectors along Z   |
| - | - |  Unit Cell Lengths & Angles    | Unit Cell Lengths & Angles      | Unit Cell Lengths & Angles      |
| - | - | Dimension | _ | Dimension 

4. Now that you have the necessary information to proceed (peaks and parameters), you can move on to Meerkat or start processing with DIALS.
5. If you are working with more than one temperature, e.g. you are working with different temperatures, follow 3b. to automate xds.
