# MSP-Solid-State
## This repository will house MSP Solid State Projects 
This repository is made for the purpose of having a collective space where MSP students and staff can find tutorials, guides and resources about any subject of solid state physics and chemistry. 
### How to use:
- the repository will house multiple folders which each act as sub-repositories
- There should be one sub-repository / subject
- Every sub-repository should contain its own README.md to make it clear what the purpose is. 
- Enjoy!
